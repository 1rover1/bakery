# Config.yml

Config.yml is the heart of Bakery. This is the central place where you add your configuration details. Details such as AWS environments, AWS accounts, access types, etc.

Once you have added your details, you can then deploy Bakery and Burger. Deployment involves creating CloudFormation templates, which use config.yml.

Refer to [Quickstart](../README.md#quickstart) on how to deploy Bakery and Burger.
